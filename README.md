# Bands

Bands is just a simple app that acts as a website template for my various musical projects.  It takes the domain name and delivers content based on which site the user is visiting.

## Features
- Supports multiple domains
- Delivers content based on domain name

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

__Note:__ To see the various bands locally, you wil need to create records in you local host file for the various domains.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
